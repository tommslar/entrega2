When i was younger 
I saw my daddy cry 
And cursed at the wind 
He broke his own heart 
And i watched 
As he tried to reassemble it 

And my momma swore that 
She would never let herself forget 
And that was the day i promised 
Id never sing of love 
If it does not exist 

But darlin, 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 

Maybe i know, somewhere 
Deep in my soul 
That love never lasts 
And we've got to find other ways 
To make it alone 
Or keep a straight face 

And i've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that i was content
With loneliness

Cos none of it was ever worth the risk, but 

You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 

Ive got a tight grip on reality 
But i cant 
Let go of what's in front of me here 
I know your leaving 
In the morning, when you wake up 
Leave me with some proof its not a dream 

Ohh--- 

You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 

And im on my way to believing it. 
Oh, And Im on my way to believing it.
