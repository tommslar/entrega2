SPERS IN THE MORNING
OF LOVERS SLEEPING TIGHT
ARE ROLLING LIKE THUNDER NOW
AS I LOOK IN YOUR EYES

I HOLD ON TO YOUR BODY
AND FEEL EACH MOVE YOU MAKE
YOUR VOICE IS WARM AND TENDER
A LOVE THAT I COULD NOT FORSAKE

(FIRST CHORUS)
CAUSE I AM YOUR LADY
AND YOU ARE MY MAN
WHENEVER YOU REACH FOR ME
ILL DO ALL THAT I CAN

LOST IS HOW IM FEELING LYING IN YOUR ARMS
WHEN THE WORLD OUTSIDES TOO
MUCH TO TAKE
THAT ALL ENDS WHEN IM WITH YOU

EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE TIMES
IT SEEMS IM FAR AWAY
NEVER WONDER WHERE I AM
CAUSE I AM ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

(REPEAT FIRST CHORUS)

(SECOND CHORUS)
WERE HEADING FOR SOMETHING
SOMEWHERE IVE NEVER BEEN
SOMETIMES I AM FRIGHTENED
BUT IM READY TO LEARN
OF THE POWER OF LOVE

THE SOUND OF YOUR HEART BEATING
MADE IT CLEAR
SUDDENLY THE FEELING THAT I CANT GO ON
IS LIGHT YEARS AWAY
