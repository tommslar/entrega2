I look at you all the love there that's sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping
still my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know why nobody told you
how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
they bought and sold you.

I look at the world and i notice it's turning
while my guitar gently weeps
with every mistake we must surely be learning
still my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know how you were diverted
you were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
no one alerted you.
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
look at you all...
still my guitar gently weeps.
