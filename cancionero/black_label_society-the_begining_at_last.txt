"The Beginning...At Last"

Have all you are and all you're to be
Fade in your world and all that you see
This hole in the wall is all under your thumb
Pulling your senses until you become

Until you become
I gotta run
I just gotta run
Cought in a world where
you could never run too fast
To finally reach
The Beginning...
...At Last

Dismantling comfort of those you surround
Place joy upon strangers
Now ain't that profound
This hole in the wall is under your thumb
Pulling your senses
Until you become...

Where You Going?
Never knowing
Just who and where
You gotta turn, turn
Forever caring
Forever sharing
You never learn, learn
Lifetime of getting burned, burned
