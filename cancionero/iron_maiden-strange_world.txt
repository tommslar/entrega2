The only place where you can dream,
Living here is not what it seems.
Ship of white light in the sky,
Nobody there to reason why.

Here I am, I'm not really there,
Smiling faces ever so rare.
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place.

Stalks of light grow from the ground 
When i cry there isn't a sound 
All my feelings cannot be held 
I'm happy in my new strange world

Leaves of green grasses twine 
Girls drinking plasma wine 
Look at love and dream unfolds 
Living here you'll never grow old
